# goqu-examples

This repository has a series of examples of using
[Goqu](https://github.com/doug-martin/goqu) to build progressively complex
queries that exercise Postgres's text search, JSON, and geo-spatial features.
It's the Goqu equivalent of the SQLAlchemy examples in [this blog
post](http://btubbs.com/postgres-search-with-facets-and-location-awareness.html).
